# Windows Forms Battle Ship Game
 A random PLAYER vs PC Battle Ship game made using Windows Forms
 C# when i was in high school.

## You only have to start the game
My native language is brazilian portuguese so the game by default is displayed in portuguese. unfortunately I didn't create a basic translation system.

## Put your's four boats

Theoretically it doesn't matter because the bot results are randomly generated in one of the array positions, but I gave this option to make the game more fun and interesting.

## And try to randomly hit the enemy

After placing your ships, you have 10 rounds to destroy the 4 strategically placed enemy ships at random, otherwise the game will be considered a war of resistance and you will lose the game, just as if you lost your 4 ships.
